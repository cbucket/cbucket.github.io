# Memo
(Ben Grimer 27/05/22)

## Introduction
This is a javascript program I found on the internet somewhere. I think there are links in the
sourcecode file memo.htm.  You can also try http://javascript.internet.com.

## Update 27/05/22
The above links do not seem to work but I found another link here:
https://www.pleacher.com/mp/puzzles/intergam/g9.html

## [Memo2](https://cbucket.github.io/memo2/memo2a.htm)
The Memo2 sibling folder contains a rewrite I did which uses the old Memory Games card we had
at Grandads house years ago. See the readme.md file in that folder for details.

## Bugs
One of the squares is blank. Look at the original at:
https://www.pleacher.com/mp/puzzles/intergam/g9.html to figure out the problem.
Perhaps just compare the source files.
